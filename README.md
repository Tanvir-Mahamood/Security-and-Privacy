## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install using pip):

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptography-algorithms.git
cd cryptography-algorithms
```

## 🚀 Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its own directory with a main Python file (`encription_main.py`) and associated text files for input/output.

### General Steps:

1. Navigate to the desired algorithm directory
2. Edit the `plaintext_sender.txt` file with your message
3. Run the encryption/decryption script:

```bash
python encription_main.py
```

4. View the results in the output files

### Example: Running Caesar Cipher

```bash
cd "CryptoBasics"
python encription_main.py
```

The program will:
- Read plaintext from `plaintext_sender.txt`
- Encrypt the message
- Write ciphertext to `ciphertext.txt`
- Decrypt the ciphertext
- Write decrypted text to `plaintext_receiver.txt`

## 📖 Algorithms Description

### 1. CryptoBasics

**Classical Cryptography Techniques:**

- **Caesar Cipher**: Substitution cipher that shifts letters by a fixed number
- **Mono Alphabetic Substitution**: Each letter is replaced by another letter according to a key
- **Columnar Transposition**: Characters are rearranged based on a columnar pattern

### 2. DES (Data Encryption Standard)

A symmetric-key algorithm that uses a 56-bit key to encrypt 64-bit blocks of data through 16 rounds of permutation and substitution.

### 3. Triple DES (3DES)

An enhancement of DES that applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block, providing stronger encryption.

### 4. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

Modern symmetric encryption standard using key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. Considered highly secure and widely used today.

### 5. RSA

An asymmetric cryptographic algorithm using public and private keys. Based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

### 6. Diffie-Hellman Algorithm

A key exchange protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel.

### 7. Man in the Middle Attack

A demonstration of security vulnerabilities in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, showing how an attacker (Darth) can intercept communications between Alice and Bob.
